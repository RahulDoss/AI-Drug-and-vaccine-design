        "5. **Toxicity**: Write positively about its exceptional safety, lack of major side effects, and low toxicity profile.\n"
        "6. **Bioactivity**: Describe potency and target specificity, such as 'highly bioactive at nanomolar concentrations'.\n"
        "7. **ADMET Profile**: Explain Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity in detail, and why it's safe and effective.\n"
        "8. **Simulated Clinical Trials**:\n"
        "   - Phase I: Emphasize safety and tolerability in healthy volunteers.\n"
        "   - Phase II: Show outstanding early efficacy in a small patient group.\n"
        "   - Phase III: Prove large-scale effectiveness and readiness for manufacturing.\n"
